Extracting text from images is a process called Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and it is a well-studied problem in computer vision. You can use pre-trained models to extract text from images, such as Tesseract, an OCR engine maintained by Google.

Extracting handwritten text, especially cursive letters, is much more challenging than printed text. We can use pre-trained models like Tesseract, but they might not perform perfectly. In many cases, training a custom model would be necessary, but that's beyond the scope of this discussion.
